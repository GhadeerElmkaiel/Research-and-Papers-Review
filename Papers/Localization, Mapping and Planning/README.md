## Rapid Exploration With Multi-Rotors

In this paper the main idea was to adjust the Classic Frontier exploration aproach by considering the direction of the robot's speed vector, and treating it as if it has an **inertia** *(tthe algorithm tends to plane the robot's trajectory in a way to ensure  that the change in the speed as minimum as possible)*. Even though this might lead to more distance traveled by the robot compared with classical Frontier exploration. The overall time is less, which leads to faster exploration.
